# Break repeating-key XOR
#
# It is officially on, now.
#
#   This challenge isn't conceptually hard, but it involves actual
#   error-prone coding. The other challenges in this set are there to bring
#   you up to speed. This one is there to qualify you. If you can do this
#   one, you're probably just fine up to Set 6.
#
# There's a file here:
#
#   http://cryptopals.com/static/challenge-data/6.txt
#
# It's been base64'd after being encrypted with repeating-key XOR.
#
# Decrypt it.
#
# Here's how:
#
#   1. Let KEYSIZE be the guessed length of the key; try values from 2 to
#      (say) 40.
#   2. Write a function to compute the edit distance/Hamming distance between
#      two strings. The Hamming distance is just the number of differing
#      bits. The distance between:
#
#          this is a test
#
#      and
#
#          wokka wokka!!!
#
#      is 37. *Make sure your code agrees before you proceed.*
#   3. For each KEYSIZE, take the first KEYSIZE worth of bytes, and the
#      second KEYSIZE worth of bytes, and find the edit distance between them.
#      Normalize this result by dividing by KEYSIZE.
#   4. The KEYSIZE with the smallest normalized edit distance is probably the
#      key. You could proceed perhaps with the smallest 2-3 KEYSIZE values.
#      Or take 4 KEYSIZE blocks instead of 2 and average the distances.
#   5. Now that you probably know the KEYSIZE: break the ciphertext into
#      blocks of KEYSIZE length.
#   6. Now transpose the blocks: make a block that is the first byte of every
#      block, and a block that is the second byte of every block, and so on.
#   7. Solve each block as if it was single-character XOR. You already have
#      code to do this.
#   8. For each block, the single-byte XOR key that produces the best looking
#      histogram is the repeating-key XOR key byte for that block. Put them
#      together and you have the key.
#
# This code is going to turn out to be surprisingly useful later on. Breaking
# repeating-key XOR ("VigenÃ¨re") statistically is obviously an academic
# exercise, a "Crypto 101" thing. But more people "know how" to break it than
# can actually break it, and a similar technique breaks something much more
# important.
#
# No, that's not a mistake.
#
#   We get more tech support questions for this challenge than any of the
#   other ones. We promise, there aren't any blatant errors in this text.
#   In particular: the "wokka wokka!!!" edit distance really is 37.
